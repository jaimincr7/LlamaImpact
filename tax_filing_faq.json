Unauthorized third parties can't change a taxpayer's address.Changes of address through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) may update your address of record on file with us based on what they retain in their National Change of Address (NCOA) database. However, even when you notify the USPS, not all post offices forward government checks, so you should still notify us.For changes of address relating to an employment tax return, we issue confirmation notices (Notices148Aand148B) for the change to both the new and former address.It can generally take four to six weeks after receipt for a change of address request to fully process.Additional Information:Revenue Procedure 2010-16Subcategory:Address changesCategory:IRS procedures"

        "question": "Is money received from the sale of inherited property considered taxable income?",
        "answer": "Answer:To determine if the sale of inherited property is taxable, you must first determine your basis in the property. The basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of the following:The fair market value (FMV) of the property on the date of the decedent's death (whether or not the executor of the estate files an estate tax return (Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return)).The FMV of the property on the alternate valuation date, but only if the executor of the estate files an estate tax return (Form 706) and elects to use the alternate valuation on that return. See theInstructions for Form 706.For information on the FMV of inherited property on the date of the decedent\u2019s death, contact the executor of the decedent\u2019s estate. In 2015, Congress passed a law that, in certain circumstances, requires the recipient\u2019s basis in certain inherited property to be consistent with the value of the property as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes. If you receive a Schedule A to Form 8971 from an executor of an estate or other person required to file an estate tax return, you may be required to report a basis consistent with the estate tax value of the property. For more information, seePublication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators.If you or your spouse gave the property to the decedent within one year\u00a0before the decedent's death, seePublication 551, Basis of Assets.Report the sale onSchedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Lossesand onForm 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets:If you sell the property for more than your basis, you have a taxable gain.For information on how to report the sale on Schedule D, seePublication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.An accuracy-related penalty may apply if an individual reporting the sale of certain inherited property uses a basis in excess of that property\u2019s final value for Federal estate tax purposes.

        "question": "I'm a minister and receive a salary plus a housing allowance. Is the housing allowance considered income and where do I report it?",
        "answer": "Answer:A minister's housing allowance (sometimes called a parsonage allowance or a rental allowance) is excludable from gross income for income tax purposes but not for self-employment tax purposes.If you receive as part of your salary (for services as a minister) an amount officially designated (in advance of payment) as a housing allowance, and the amount isn\u2019t more than reasonable pay for your services, you can exclude from gross income the lesser of the following amounts:the amount officially designated (in advance of payment) as a housing allowance;the amount actually used to provide or rent a home; orthe fair market rental value of the home (including furnishings, utilities, garage, etc.).The payments officially designated as a housing allowance must be used in the year received.Include any amount of the allowance that you can't exclude as wages on line 1h ofForm 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax ReturnorForm 1040-SR, U.S. Tax Return for Seniors.

        "question": "Can I still file my taxes in TurboTax after the October 15 deadline?",
        "answer": "If you missed the October 15 tax extension deadline, but already started your return in TurboTax Online, you generally have until October 31 to file your return online in TurboTax, but it may be subject to late filing fees. If your return gets rejected after the deadline, you may have some extra time to fix and resubmit your return to the IRS without being subject to late-filing fees. As long as your return is submitted by the due date, you're given: 5 days to resubmit the return electronically 10 days to resubmit the return via mail Note: If your TurboTax navigation looks different from what’s described here, learn more. TurboTax Online: To resubmit, simply follow the onscreen instructions after signing in. If you choose to paper-file, select Finish & File and follow the steps to file by mail. TurboTax Desktop: To resubmit, reopen your return and follow the onscreen instructions. If you choose to paper-file, select the File by mail option. After October 31, you can't start, finish, or e-file new returns in TurboTax Online. You'll need to use TurboTax Desktop, and then mail your return. Some exceptions may apply for amending and resubmitting rejected returns previously filed through TurboTax Online."

        "question": "What's the IRS penalty if I miss the October 15 extension filing deadline?",
        "answer": "The IRS applies late penalties and interest on a case-by-case basis and will send a separate bill if penalties apply. Because the IRS has the last word on penalties, we can't calculate the exact amount if your return is late. But we'll give you an idea of what to expect in a worst-case scenario. There are two types of fees that may apply, plus interest on any unpaid taxes: Late filing penalties apply if you owe taxes and didn't file your return or extension by April 15, or if you filed an extension but failed to file your return by October 15. The late filing penalty is 5% of the additional taxes owed amount for every month (or fraction thereof) your return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. If you file more than 60 days after the due date, the minimum penalty is $485 (for tax returns required to be filed in 2024) or 100% of your unpaid tax, whichever is less. Late payment penalties apply if you didn't pay taxes owed by April 15, regardless of whether you filed an extension or not. The late payment penalty is 0.5% (1/2 of 1%) of the additional tax owed amount for every month (or fraction thereof) the owed tax remains unpaid, up to a maximum of 25%.For any month(s) in which both the late-payment and late-filing penalties apply, the late filing penalty will be reduced by the amount of the late payment penalty applied in that month. For example, instead of a 5% late filing penalty for the month, the IRS would apply a 4.5% late filing penalty and a 0.5% late payment penalty. Interest (compounded daily) starts accumulating on unpaid taxes one day after the due date of the return, until the bill is fully paid off. The interest rate is the federal short-term rate plus 3%. You won't face a penalty if: You file by October 15, provided you filed an extension and paid your tax bill by April 15, or You're getting a tax refund. However, you must file your taxes by April 15 three years from tax year for which you are filing (or October 15 three years from the tax year for which you are filing if you filed an extension). After that, any unclaimed tax refunds get turned over to the U.S. Treasury. Example: Let's say you didn't file your return by the April 15 deadline and you owe the IRS an additional $1,000. Scenario 1: You file an extension on or before April 15 and pay your $1,000 bill on April 25 (10 days late). Your penalty would be $5 (the 0.5% late-payment penalty applied to $1,000), plus another dollar or so for the interest. Scenario 2: You didn't file an extension, and you file your return on April 25 (10 days late) along with your $1,000 payment. Your penalty would be $50 (the 5% late-filing penalty applied to $1,000), plus another dollar or so for the interest.What if I submitted my return before October 15, but it was rejected? You have through October 20 to fix and resubmit your return to the IRS without being subject to late filing fees. What if I miss the October 20 deadline to resubmit my rejected return? You can still resubmit your rejected return through November 15 9PM PT, but your return could be subject to late filing or payment penalties. What if I miss the November 15 e-file deadline to resubmit my return? No worries, you can print and mail your return, but late penalties may apply. Unfinished TurboTax Online returns can be transferred to the TurboTax Desktop software for paper-filing."
